I am a [Postdoctoral Research Associate](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.rawson) working within the [Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jameel-institute/) at Imperial College London.

Before this, I was a DPhil student within the [Mathematical Ecology Research Group](https://merg.zoo.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. 

I am principally a mathematical modeller, whose [research](thomrawson.github.io/research) focusses on a variety of Public Health topics. I am interested in utilising a suite of mathematical methods to unlock the full potential of public health data - most commonly Bayesian inference, optimal control approaches, stochastic differential systems, and spatial analysis.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic I have been a part of the Imperial College real time modelling team, providing disease trajectory projections to help inform ongoing government policy.
