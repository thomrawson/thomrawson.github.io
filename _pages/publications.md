###[How and when to end the COVID-19 lockdown: an optimization approach](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00262)
Published in *Frontiers in Public Health*, 2020

This paper considered the dynamic impact of strict lockdowns on the spread of COVID-19, and investigated optimal methods of "unlocking".

###[Non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccination, and the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in England: a mathematical modelling study](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02276-5)
Published in *The Lancet*, 2021

This paper summarised the epidemiological dynamics of the Delta variant within the UK, ultimately presenting the need for an extension to `Stage 4' of the third UK lockdown.

###[A mathematical model of Campylobacter dynamics within a broiler flock](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01940)
Published in *Frontiers in Microbiology*, 2019

The first mathematical model of *Campylobacter* population dynamics within a broiler flock.

###[Optimal control approaches for combining medicines and mosquito control in tackling dengue](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.181843)
Published in *Royal Society Open Science*, 2020

An investigation of how to combine vaccines with vector-control techniques in tackling dengue. We show that both interventions should be used in tandem, as both impact the spread of disease in distinct ways.

###[A hierarchical Bayesian quantitative microbiological risk assessment model for Salmonella in the sheep meat food chain](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2021.103975)
Published in *Food Microbiology*, 2022

The first risk assessment model of *Salmonella* prevalence within the sheep meat food chain. I show that while the risk to consumers remains very low compared to other meat products, the abattoir is the key point of bacterial proliferation in the sheep meat food chain.
